# Signals

## Status

* **Champion(s):** TBD
* **Author(s):** Rob Eisenberg
* **Stage**: 0

## Motivation

*Why is this important to have in the JavaScript language?*

## Use cases

*Some realistic scenarios using the feature, with both code and description of the problem; more than one can be helpful.*

## Description

*Developer-friendly documentation for how to use the feature.*

## Comparison

*A comparison across various related programming languages and/or libraries. If this is the first sort of language or library to do this thing, explain why that is the case. If this is a standard library feature, a comparison across the JavaScript ecosystem would be good; if it's a syntax feature, that might not be practical, and comparisons may be limited to other programming languages.*

## Implementations

### Polyfill/transpiler implementations

*A JavaScript implementation of the proposal, ideally packaged in a way that enables easy, realistic experimentation. See [implement.md](https://github.com/tc39/how-we-work/blob/master/implement.md) for details on creating useful prototype implementations.*

### Native implementations

*For Stage 3+ proposals, and occasionally earlier, it is helpful to link to the implementation status of full, end-to-end JavaScript engines. Filing these issues before Stage 3 is somewhat unnecessary, though, as it's not very actionable.*

## FAQ

*Frequently asked questions, or questions you think might be asked. Issues on the issue tracker or questions from past reviews can be a good source for these.*
